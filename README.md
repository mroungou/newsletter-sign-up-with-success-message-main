## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this challenge required using JS I got to practice creating functions and practicing manipulating the DOM and working with event listeners.


### Continued development

In the future I would like to continue working on the JS form validation as well as using a framework such as React or Vue.
